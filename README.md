## Using this to learn Unit Testing and Static Analysis

### I want to use a lot of React and other JS Frameworks, so I plan on doing some quick learning on how to Unit Test and run Static Analysis to help boost my skills.

### I'm going to install React + Typescript via Vite.

### I plan on using ESLint as my static analysis package, along with Prettier as my VSCode extension to help.

### I plan on using Vitest and the React Testing Library to set up my Unit Tests.

### What do I plan on testing? I think we'll work on a tiny responsive app that's just a button.
